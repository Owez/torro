# torro

A **correct** and **easy-to-use** BitTorrent library

## Objectives

- Easy-to-use library interface that assumes by default with customisability if needed
- Extremely low dependency count (none ideally)
- High amount of documentation, no data structures/functions implemented without a line of docstring
- Correctness with the BitTorrent protocols

## Development/Production Status

Actively developed but heavily work-in-progress with only `.torrent` to user-friendly Torrent struct currently fully supported, see the torro [roadmap](https://github.com/Owez/torro/issues/20) for future plans.
