# torro

A **correct** and **easy-to-use** BitTorrent library

## Objectives

- Easy-to-use library interface that assumes by default with customisability if needed
- Extremely low dependency count (none ideally)
- High amount of documentation, no data structures/functions implemented without a line of docstring
- Correctness with the BitTorrent protocols

## Development/Production Status

Heavily work-in-progress with only `.torrent` (bencode) parsing currently supported. You may contribute [here](https://github.com/owez/torro) if you'd like.
